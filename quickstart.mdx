## 🚧 Build Locally, Ship Globally

You're just 3 steps away from unleashing a sleek, developer-first docsite that vibes with your API stack and scales with your tech vision 🚀.

### 🔧 Step 1: Set Up Your Dev Playground

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-open" title="Clone Your Docs Engine">
    Clone the GitHub repo you've already wired up — it's your core for building awesome tech documentation.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-docs-repo.git
    cd your-docs-repo
    ```

    <Tip>Keep this synced with your backend magic. Every push = cleaner docs.</Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Spin Up Local Dev Server">
    Start your live preview server to edit in real-time like a boss:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and watch the magic happen ✨.

### 🚀 Step 2: Make It _Yours_

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="paintbrush" title="Brand Your Docs like a Pro">
    Open your `docs.json` or config file and add your unique flavor:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Tech-Ocean",
      "theme": "darkwave",
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#0ea5e9",
        "dark": "#0f172a",
        "light": "#38bdf8"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>Use Tailwind palette or your brand hex codes to glow up your docs site 🌈</Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cloud-upload" title="Push to the Net — Deploy It">
    Commit your changes and push them:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "🚀 First commit for Tech-Ocean Docs"
    git push origin main
    ```

    Your CI/CD (Vercel, Netlify, or whatever fire you use) will auto-deploy it.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🌍 Step 3: Go Global. Share It.

<Accordion icon="globe" title="Publish Your Docs to the World">
  Boom — your docs are live. Share the URL with your dev squad, users, or community.

Need a custom domain? Add it in your hosting settings and flex your `.dev` domain like a real one 💻.
